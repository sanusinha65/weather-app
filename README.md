# Approach

## Structure

First, I created the basic structure of the Weather App based on the requirements. I organized the project into reusable components, focusing on clarity and maintainability. The main components included WeatherDisplay, WeatherForecast, and the unit toggle button, with a clear separation of concerns for better scalability.

## Design

Since I have an interest in UI/UX design, I ensured the app would provide a smooth and visually appealing user experience. I drew inspiration from various popular weather apps to create a minimalist design with easy-to-read information. I also focused on making the interface responsive so it would work seamlessly across various devices, ensuring both mobile and desktop users would have a pleasant experience.

## Functions

After setting up the basic structure, I started implementing the core functionality. This included fetching real-time weather data and the forecast using the OpenWeather API. I implemented the functionality for switching between Celsius and Fahrenheit, making sure the app displayed weather data correctly based on the selected unit. I also added a real-time clock to show the current time, which updates every second.

## Implementation

Once the core functionality was in place, I moved on to refining the code. I optimized the logic to minimize re-renders and ensured that the application was performant. I also worked on fine-tuning the design, incorporating smooth animations like sliding transitions for the unit switch button and hover effects for interactive elements. Tailwind CSS was used to streamline the styling process and ensure responsiveness across all screen sizes.

## Testing

After completing the main UI/UX design and functionality, I thoroughly tested the app on different devices, checking for responsiveness and performance. I ensured the weather data was fetched correctly and the unit toggle button worked smoothly. To get feedback from real users, I also shared the app with family and friends, who provided valuable insights. This allowed me to make final adjustments to both the design and the user experience.

## Deployment

Once everything was working as expected, I deployed the Weather App to a live server for final review. I ensured that the app was fully functional in a production environment, and I submitted the project for assignment review, confident that it met all the requirements and offered a smooth user experience.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
